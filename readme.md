## Description
CoinHiz is a cryptocurrency focused application where users can track price trends of top coins, the top gainers, news in the industry, percentage mined, and even see a responsive chart showing the price history of a given coin (my feature). I also handled much of the styling for this application as well as contributing to the favorites functionality. The languages, technologies, and frameworks used to build this application are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. Data is pulled by fetching from multiple sophisticated APIs.

## Usage
See the top gainers at the top of section of the page. See what coins people are talking about ib the Twitter feed just below that. See the top coins and a chart showing their price history. Favorite coins and see them presented on the Favorites page. Search for a Bitcoin ATM near you (currently inactive).
